# Bedsy üõèÔ∏è

Find medical beds in Chennai. Deployed at [bedsy-tn.in](https://bedsy-tn.in/)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## NOTE:

All the data has been fetched from the TN government API (same as https://tncovidbeds.tnega.org/). It's a pretty cool app.

Also OSM is cool af.
